# books

API to verify how it works lagom framework

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit 8
- SBT 1.3.12

### Steps

- Run the project with `sbt runAll`.
- Connect to the cassandra integrated server through cassandra cli or Datagrid Intellij.
- Create a keyspace named `books`.
- Stop the project and run again; this will create the necessary tables.

## Design Patterns

- Event Sourcing (ES)
- Command Query Responsability Segregation (CQRS)

## To consider

- Event sourcing saves each state change, so you will found a table `messages` on cassandra with the data
and the table `books` with data too. This is fine, but you must follow the `books` table where we 
save the data. `messages` table is only to rerun the change of the state of an object.
- Each model, command or event mus be register on `BooksSerializerRegistry` to return the object on 
JSON format.
- A command receives the data and must or must not return the event, this is not attach to the command,
you can return an object, but inside the command function calls the event (following the event sourcing),
and that will call the processor.
- Lagom can works without ES and CQRS.
